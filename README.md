# Master-Thesis

Appendix 1 and Appendix 2 are Python codes that implement Darcy's flow formulation on a 2D unit square porous medium.

Appendix 3 implements the multi-compartment Darcy porous media flow model on 3 compartments existing in the same spatial domain.

FEniCS 2018.1.0 is required. FEniCS can be installed via the standard Ubuntu package manager apt-get.

To run any one the Appendices on FEniCS, use the Ubuntu terminal to locate the directory where the python file is located and enter the following line in the terminal and hit enter:

python3 file name.py

Paraview v5.x is required to view the numerical output.
